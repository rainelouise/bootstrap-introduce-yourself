            <p>I've always loved drawing ever since I was a kid. Everyone in class calls me the "art kid". When I was in high school, I always joined poster-making contests and always ended up being in first place. But when I became a college student, I stopped drawing because I didn't have much free time like before. Luckily, we had a class called "Art Appreciation" that made us draw a portrait of our friend. The image here is a portrait I made for my friend Alex! :)</p>

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Crocheting</h5>
            <p>My mom used to crochet before, and I tried to learn by myself because I want to be like her. This is my current hobby because it helps me relax and rest my eyes from too much exposure with gadgets. It just started as a hobby and I tried selling some of my works for fun, and now I own a small business named Peachy Stitches! It's so fun so make cute plushies and I'm always happy when my customers love my works. The image here is a character from the game Honkai: Star Rail named Kafka! </p>

            <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Painting</h5>
            <p>I disliked using colored pencils when coloring my drawings, so I decided to learn painting. Mixing colors is very fun, and it's satisfying when the piece is slowly coming to life when the color is nearly done. The only thing I dislike is that it takes too long to dry. The image here is a painting I made during the pandemic (and during my Haikyuu phase). They are my favorite duo in the show, Bokuto-san and Akaashi!</p>
